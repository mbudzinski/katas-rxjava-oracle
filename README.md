## Chapter 1 - Birth

Far beyond the edge of the world there lived a peasant in a small village. One night she woke him
an extraordinary idea - I could become Oracle, Reactive Oracle. If there would be only tutor
willing to show me the way.

Reactive Oracle needs time (up to 3 seconds) to ponder a question and provide random answer from list:
* Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
* A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.
* Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love.
* Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.

Would you like to become the tutor and guide of a simple peasant to his way of enlightenment?
